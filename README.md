# number-recognition
User created number recognition program. Semi-accurate. 

To run this program:
Requirement is Python 3.7, incompatible with Python 3.8

1. pip install requirements.txt
2. python createModel.py
3. python drawNumber.py

After drawNumber runs:
Draw a number in the whitespace provided
Hit spacebar for model.h5 to execute
View the command line to see if output was correct

Notes: 
Numbers that are similarly curved have more difficulty in the model. 9 and 4 often have issues.
